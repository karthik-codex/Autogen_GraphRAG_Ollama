# Multi-Agent AI Superbot using AutoGen and GraphRAG

This application integrates GraphRAG with AutoGen agents, powered by local LLMs from Ollama, for free and offline embedding and inference. Key highlights include:
 - Integrating GraphRAG's knowledge search method with an AutoGen agent via function calling.
 - Configuring GraphRAG (local & global search) to support local models from Ollama for inference
 and embedding.
 - Extending AutoGen to support function calling with non-OpenAI LLMs from Ollama via Lite-LLM proxy
server.
 - Deploying Chainlit UI to handle continuous conversations, multi-threading, and user input settings.
